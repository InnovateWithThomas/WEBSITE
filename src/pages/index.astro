					Hi! I'm Thomas, a passionate and determined web developer with a strong interest in everything IT. My journey into tech started with simple curiosity, and quickly turned into a deep enthusiasm for coding and problem-solving.
					I love diving into new technologies, constantly learning, and finding smart solutions to tough challenges.
					I’m someone who values <em>determination</em> and <em>curiosity</em>. Always pushing to improve and stay on top of the latest trends.
					Outside of tech, I practice BJJ (Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu), a sport that teaches me <em>discipline</em>, <em>focus</em>, and <em>perseverance</em>, values I bring into my professional life too.
				</p>
				<p class="need-highlited">Let’s <em>build</em> something great together!</p>
